                    <blockquote>“We’ll live in the double helix of our children and their descendants forever.” -The
                        teal

                    </blockquote>

                    <p>The Sun is overrated. There is nothing special about the Sun. There are billions and billions of
                        other
                        stars just like it. Its internal nuclear fusion engine converts matter into energy until its
                        fuel is
                        spent, just like all other stars. It will become a red giant engulfing earth, and finally an
                        everlasting
                        white dwarf. What is unique about the Sun is us; the fact that in its third orbiting planet,
                        nature
                        attained consciousness.</p>
                    <p>​What are we before our birth? A genetic probability. Just that? Yes, and we will continue to be
                        until
                        our number is up and our existence is realized, which does not just depend on us as individuals.
                        We
                        are
                        beholden to the survival of our species. What is the beyond before our birth like? Fair. We all
                        have
                        the
                        same chance of becoming emperors or paupers, beautiful or ugly, geniuses or borderline; in
                        short,
                        the
                        genetic roulette has no bias or limit in time or space, unless as a species we cross into
                        extinction.
                        And after our death? A genetic probability. We are the concrete appearance of an abstract
                        probability.<br><br>
                        We live a very ephemeral material existence, nevertheless, if you are reading these notes, you
                        are
                        one
                        of the lucky ones, you won the genetic lottery. The pressure of our biological clock and of
                        life’s
                        daily
                        struggles prevent most of us to reflect on the power of abstract reality, that distinct marker
                        of
                        our
                        being. These teal lion conversations are a personal reflection on the significance of the human
                        brain,
                        on evolution, culture and technology, on our relationship with time and the logic of change, and
                        on
                        the
                        ultimate survival of our own species.<br><br>
                        Our brain is both rational and empathic; personal and communal; opposed to but also an integral
                        part
                        of
                        nature, a truly dialectical entity. It processes the raw sensory information into abstract
                        concepts
                        that
                        can be clustered, segregated, shaped, transformed, and synthesized in order to predict the near
                        future
                        and to plan our response with a purpose in mind.<br><br>
                        Time is in our frame of reference like a locomotive pulling a train, the “has been” and the
                        “being”
                        are
                        pulled forward by the “will be”. The logic of change is thus the never-ending movement from
                        certainty to
                        probable and back to certainty where causality is the vector and randomness is the
                        direction.<br><br>
                        The dynamics of change moves from the accumulation of incremental changes to a new emergent
                        reality,
                        that is, from quantitative modifications to a qualitative transformation of the original system.
                        The
                        fusion of oxygen and hydrogen, two distinct elements, results in the appearance of the water
                        molecule, a
                        new reality.<br><br>
                        A seed is no longer a seed the moment the bud is born, so is the bud the moment the blossom
                        springs
                        into
                        life, and the blossom itself is no longer the moment the fruit becomes a reality. In Hegelian
                        terms,
                        the
                        bud negates the seed to assert itself, so does the blossom with the bud and the fruit with the
                        blossom.
                        The cycle of life is fleeting, a continuous movement of being and becoming, a perennial
                        affirmation
                        and
                        negation of reality.<br><br>
                        Beauty is meant to be consumed and appreciated vicariously, that is, in the mind that
                        contemplates
                        it.
                        This dependence on the other’s conceptual reality in opposition to our own makes abstract beauty
                        a
                        critical marker in the transformation of homo to sapiens and the dawn of culture. In the
                        aesthetics
                        of
                        human evolution, the teal lion points out that awareness of the other’s existential reality
                        changed
                        the
                        trajectory of our species’ adaptive capabilities from genetics to culture; a transformative new
                        reality.
                        This qualitative change in our evolutionary timescale sets us in a path of ever more control of
                        nature
                        and society, a precious gift that can also become our demise.<br><br>
                        The humanoid upright walking posture freed the hands to create tools for their protection and
                        sustenance
                        that enhanced their ability to control their local environment. The evolutionary journey of the
                        free
                        hand to do ever more sophisticated work is the road map followed by the developing human brain.
                        Tools’
                        development requires purpose, purpose requires anticipating a future use, and a future tense
                        requires
                        abstract reasoning.<br><br>
                        The use of ever improving tools in the production process enhanced the productivity of the labor
                        employed, thus creating sustainable recurring surpluses which over time became available to be
                        exchanged
                        in markets. The market clearance price is the concrete appearance of abstract labor at a
                        particular
                        time
                        and place. Suppliers place market bids to fulfill an open demand and consumers purchase the bids
                        they
                        consider best fits. That is, a market price measures the monetary value of a best fit market bid
                        at
                        a
                        specific time and place.<br><br>
                        Best fit bids will attain the highest profit rates available while less optimal bids will fetch
                        a
                        lower
                        or even negative profit rates. Bids, when successful, add value to the original invested inputs,
                        thus
                        enhancing capital accumulation which in turn further improves labor productivity, and so
                        on.<br><br>
                        Property rights are the legal linchpin at the core of all market bids. The concentration of
                        capital
                        in
                        fewer and fewer hands increases its availability; which, in turn, puts downward pressure on its
                        rate
                        of
                        return, causing volatility in financial markets.<br><br>
                        Why market bids? Market bids are the most efficient allocation of scarce resources when
                        information
                        is
                        not fully available to plot a maximizing resource utilization curve of the means of production.
                        In a
                        world where information from all economic agents is readily available and actionable, market
                        bids
                        will
                        become inefficient and will wither away.<br><br>
                        Now that our labor productivity is reaching the abundance threshold, that is, the absence of
                        scarcity,
                        recurrent crisis of overproduction keeps us in the scarcity gravitational pull. This fundamental
                        contradiction is the core conflict defining our epoch.<br><br>
                        Markets’ influence will diminish as scarcity is conquered for an ever-increasing number of
                        commodities.
                        We can foresee a future where the supplying of humanity’s needs becomes a resource accounting
                        and
                        distribution algorithm on an artificial intelligence subroutine program. Free of want, humanity
                        will
                        walk a new historical path, and finally united, it will raise its gaze at the stars with renewed
                        impetus.</p><br><br>

                    <h4>DECONSTRUCTING ABSTRACT THOUGHT</h4>
                    <h5>Abstract Reasoning: A virtual approximation of reality</h5>
                    <blockquote>“Awareness of the future is what makes us humans.” -The teal lion</blockquote>
                    <p>How do we know the universe?<br><br>
                        The physical world precedes the birth of our species and the evolution of our conscience. We
                        obtain
                        information from our environment through our senses and our daily interactions, and then we
                        cluster
                        and
                        process that information in order to act upon it and bend it to our will.<br><br>
                        In other words, we create our own virtual reality, right?<br><br>
                        Yes, our mind transforms the raw sensory information into abstract concepts which it can
                        cluster,
                        segregate,
                        shape, transform, and synthesize in order to be able to predict the near future and to plan our
                        response
                        with a specific purpose in mind.<br><br>
                        I see now, we are agents of change.<br><br>
                        How do we know how close we are to the truth?<br><br>
                        The predictive power of said truth on future events.<br><br>
                        Is truth temporary?<br><br>
                        Yes, always. The epistemological process ends with a new truth that will replace the previous
                        paradigm
                        if
                        its predictive power is greater, and so on…<br><br>
                        Does our virtual reality have a life of its own?<br><br>
                        Yes, it has its own life and its own means of expression. The concept of a lion brings a lion to
                        mind
                        but is
                        independent of the living being. In its abstract form, it can be a caricature, it can be colored
                        purple,
                        it
                        can have feelings, and it can even speak.<br><br>
                        And its own means of expression?<br><br>
                        Yes, the human brain has evolved the capacity to establish logical benchmarks to identify and
                        place
                        a
                        given
                        phenomenon in space and time, as well as aesthetic patterns and mathematical and linguistic
                        symbols
                        to
                        communicate it.<br><br>
                        Is our present beholden to our past?<br><br>
                        Yes and no. The past is accounting, a reality already lived and saved. The present, on the other
                        hand,
                        is a
                        living staging area of the future and at the same time an entry into the ledger of the past. Our
                        senses
                        are
                        always locking into the present the successful experiences of the past and the open
                        possibilities of
                        the
                        near future; our virtual reality is thus, a forward-looking certainty.<br><br>
                        I see, the past is accounting, the present is certain, and the future is probable, from almost
                        certain
                        to
                        randomness.<br><br>
                        Are animals aware of the future?<br><br>
                        No. Animals live in an ever-recurring present, that’s why the architectural marvels of ants and
                        bees
                        are
                        an
                        exact copy of their last today.<br><br>
                        Does awareness of the future define consciousness?<br><br>
                        Yes. When there is no tomorrow, there is no consciousness, today’s actions have meaning in so
                        far as
                        they
                        are projected into the future. Awareness of the future is what makes us humans.<br><br>
                        Time is like a locomotive pulling a train, the “has been” and the “being” are pulled forward by
                        the
                        “will
                        be”.<br><br>
                        How does our virtual reality account for change?<br><br>
                        Change, in its abstract form, is the dynamic interplay of opposite probabilities defining a
                        given
                        reality.<br><br>
                        The accumulation of realized events over time makes ever more probable the transformation of
                        discrete
                        changes into a new quality, a change in the essence of reality.<br><br>
                        The logic of change is the never-ending movement from certainty to probable and back to
                        certainty.<br><br>
                        What about the past?<br><br>
                        The past is just memory accounting on how things actually happened, a summation of certainties
                        which
                        when
                        combined with the certain present adds predictability to the probable future.<br><br>
                        What is the most predictable outcome?<br><br>
                        Recursive systems that recreate themselves across different spatial scales over and over in an
                        ongoing
                        feedback loop are the most predictable outcome, the almost certain probability of our virtual
                        reality.<br><br>
                        In recursive systems our virtual lion will always be a lion and not a tiger, as long as in each
                        virtual
                        iteration its fractal function remains stable.<br><br>
                        Are neuron trees fractal?<br><br>
                        Yes, as they are able to identify what is stable and what might not be going forward.<br><br>
                        In the “Mandelbrot set”, the fractal function does not deviate when iterated, nevertheless, once
                        a
                        mutation
                        is introduced to the original design that compromises the function stability, a change dynamic
                        takes
                        effect
                        until a new stable function is established, and thus a new reality is born.<br><br>
                        And natural selection?<br><br>
                        Systems driven by recursion replicate successful designs with minimal effort, a most efficient
                        outcome.
                        Our
                        universe, from galaxies, to coast lines, thunder bolts to snowflakes, seashells to leaves, and
                        the
                        design of
                        our lungs and circulatory system, is fractal in nature. Life stumbles on the recursive base case
                        by
                        natural
                        selection.<br><br>
                        Fractal thinking?<br><br>
                        Yes, our mind is able to pick novelty out of a visual field by zooming in and out to the exact
                        level
                        of
                        detail and editing away all non-essentials. Our ability to attain the right level of abstraction
                        is
                        consistent with the high predictability of recursive systems.<br><br>
                        How do random events become part of our virtual reality?<br><br>
                        Random events are a fact of nature, they are change agents that when given a sufficient time
                        scale,
                        iteration after iteration, the highly improbable becomes probable, and at some point,
                        certain.<br><br>
                        Why things are the way they are now?<br><br>
                        Causality (cause and effect) drives how nature works, its inner dynamics, the almost certain
                        projection
                        of
                        the probable future; randomness is the least probable to the almost none. So, causality is the
                        vector,
                        and
                        randomness is the direction.<br><br>
                        Can you give me examples?<br><br>
                        Yes. The evolutionary history of our planet would have been similar to that of Mars if the Earth
                        and
                        the
                        Moon were not a binary planetary system that provided stability to the Earth’s rotational
                        movement
                        underpinning the retention of its atmosphere.<br><br>
                        Similarly, a couple of major events changed the direction of the development of life on Earth
                        and
                        the
                        evolution and ascendency of the human brain.<br><br>
                        First, the cataclysmic disappearance of the big reptilians, a random event, opened the
                        evolutionary
                        door
                        for
                        the warm-blooded mammalians to step in.<br><br>
                        Next, the incremental receding of the original African jungle habitat and the expansion of the
                        African
                        savannah as a result of climate change provided a causal avenue for the development of the human
                        brain,
                        from
                        subsistence accounting to abstract reasoning.<br><br>
                        The humanoid upright walking posture freed the hands to create tools for their protection and
                        sustenance
                        that enhanced their ability to control their local environment. The evolutionary journey of the
                        free
                        hand to
                        do ever more sophisticated work is the road map followed by the developing human brain.<br><br>
                        Tools’ development requires purpose, purpose requires anticipating a future use, and a future
                        tense
                        requires
                        abstract reasoning.</p><br><br>

                    <blockquote>“Acknowledging the other’s existential reality opened the doors to our own consciousness
                        and to

                        humanity.” - The teal lion</blockquote>
                    <p>
                        The visual pathways in the brain lead to areas populated by neurons that “mirror”, that is,
                        imitate
                        the
                        behavior of others, as though the observer was actually acting. Mirroring acknowledges a mind
                        other
                        than
                        our
                        own.<br><br>
                        Mirroring another’s acts opened the door for empathy, imitation, and learning, the foundations
                        of
                        cultural
                        evolution.<br><br>
                        The human brain developed visual properties that originally specialized in promoting the
                        survival of
                        our
                        species, such as grouping, isolating, deconstructing (peak shift), integrating, magnification
                        (accentuation), minimization (attenuation), regularity, chaos, symmetry, and asymmetry.<br><br>
                        These virtual spectrums display myriads of possibilities associated with the cultural concept of
                        beauty.
                        Furthermore, it also acts as a reinforcing loop enhancing the development of the visual pathways
                        that
                        sustain their architecture.<br><br>
                        What is beauty?<br><br>
                        Beauty is a cultural selection process aimed to reinforce those “mirror” pathways leading to
                        self-awareness
                        and introspection. Beauty is meant to be consumed and appreciated vicariously. Beauty is in the
                        eye
                        of
                        the
                        beholder, that is, in the mind that contemplates it.<br><br>
                        This dependence on the other conceptual reality in opposition to our own makes abstract beauty a
                        critical
                        marker in the transformation of homo to sapiens and the dawn of culture.<br><br>
                        Is nature neutral when it comes to beauty?<br><br>
                        Yes. Nature has no concept of beauty, nevertheless, our virtual reality does.<br><br>
                        Let’s start with grouping; the brain’s ability to paste together patterns and to fill in the
                        blanks
                        to
                        discern fully developed contours.<br><br>
                        Our brain is able to group patterns of similar brown squares scattered among the dissimilar
                        greenish
                        foliage
                        to conceptually reconstruct a lion on the prowl. This economy of processing to quickly solve a
                        visual
                        puzzle
                        with less than perfect information was highly successful as a critical survival skill in the
                        African
                        savannah.<br><br>
                        Economy of processing?<br><br>
                        Yes. Grouping and deconstructing are readily used in our virtual reality to move from
                        probability to
                        certainty, a very successful survival skill.<br><br>
                        Patterns of colors that provide a similar sense of integration and oneness are a well-known
                        aesthetic
                        principle.<br><br>
                        In Van Gogh’s “Sunflowers”, the different tones of brown, yellow, green, as well as the red and
                        blue
                        accents
                        are integrated in such a sensually pleasing manner as to make the whole canvas a powerful image
                        of
                        life,
                        energy and vitality.<br><br>
                        The opposite of grouping is isolation; our brain is able to zoom on the individual image by
                        focusing
                        on
                        its
                        borders. It discards the fuzzy original contour by sharpening the lines separating the tree from
                        the
                        forest,
                        the same way a sketch provides an accurate portrait of the contours of a particular
                        object.<br><br>
                        The brain moves from the generic grouping to the individual sketching in a seamless efficient
                        process.
                        Furthermore, sketching is critical to image modular deconstructing since the now clearly defined
                        borders
                        can
                        be manipulated to magnify a small set of properties that capture the essence of the isolated
                        object
                        in a
                        few
                        strokes.<br><br>
                        These accentuated features move the identification process from the realm of probability to that
                        of
                        certainty. Peak shifts, as they are known in neuroscience, are the image fingerprints. Henri
                        Matisse’s
                        “Blue
                        Nude” uses peak shifts to portrait the intrinsic beauty of the human female body with a few
                        strokes
                        (cutouts) of blue paint.<br><br>
                        Peak shifts are a very sophisticated abstraction. When were we able to process it?<br><br>
                        The artists responsible for the beautiful Chauvet Cave paintings used peak shifted sketches to
                        leave
                        a
                        vivid
                        portrait of the essence of life as humans experienced it 30,000 years ago. Lions, mammoths,
                        bison,
                        rhinos,
                        and other animals are deconstructed and sketched using their image fingerprints with such
                        precision
                        as
                        that
                        used by Picasso in his “Don Quixote” drawing, where the painter, in an economy of strokes, is
                        able
                        to
                        evoke
                        the essence of the novel’s fictional characters; the slightly deranged knightly figure and that
                        of
                        his
                        squire Sancho, in the middle of an empty field full of allegorical windmills.<br><br>
                        Boundary accentuation and boundary attenuation are dialectical visual opposites moving our
                        visual
                        perspective from panoramic to zooming and back effortlessly. Our mind is able to pick novelty
                        out of
                        a
                        visual field by zooming in and out to the exact level of detail and editing away all
                        non-essentials.
                        Similarly, symmetry is a desirable feature of boundary accentuation and individuality while
                        asymmetry is
                        a
                        preferred feature of boundary attenuation.<br><br>
                        Impressionism is the conscious elimination of boundaries focusing instead on scene content and
                        scene
                        detail.
                        Monet’s “Impression, Sunrise” is an example of the premeditated blurring of individual
                        boundaries
                        through
                        the use of a color palette to accentuate the whole. Accentuation of boundaries is also a
                        powerful
                        seductive
                        visual image; Raphael’s painting “La Fornarina” is a beautiful example of the “belle donne”,
                        where
                        there
                        is
                        an emphasis on the accentuation of female forms.<br><br>
                        The Dutch painter Gerard van Honthorst uses chiaroscuro (light-shadow) contrasting to accentuate
                        the
                        female
                        figure on his rendering of “The Matchmaker”, a magnificent piece. The Spanish painter Diego
                        Velázquez
                        captures in a few masterful strokes the keen individual gaze of his enslaved assistant Juan de
                        Pareja, a
                        feat of beauty that rendered the portrait one for the ages.<br><br>
                        Our visual preference for scene orderliness and predictability contrasts with the strong
                        suspicion
                        we
                        hold
                        for unexplained coincidences, such a dichotomy promotes an unstable balance between regularity
                        and
                        chaos.<br><br>
                        So, imagination is essential to our humanity, right?<br><br>
                        Yes. The virtual manipulation of natural image properties such as light, dimensions, colors,
                        volumes,
                        figures, distances, perspectives, and so on, has given us classics, chiaroscuros, cubists,
                        impressionists,
                        surrealists, abstract, and figurative painters among others.<br><br>
                        The aesthetic of human evolution, that fantastic feat of imagination, was forged in the primeval
                        cauldron of
                        genetic adaptation through the natural selection of “mirror” neurons.<br><br>
                        Acknowledging the other’s existential reality opened the doors to our group consciousness and to
                        our
                        humanity, thus changing the trajectory of our species’ evolution from genetics to culture. This
                        qualitative
                        change in our evolutionary timescale set us in a path of ever more control of nature and
                        society, a
                        precious
                        gift that can also become our demise.<br><br></p>

                    <p>Nature is blind to value.<br><br>
                        One trout in the river has absolutely no economic value, one trout in the fisherman’s
                        basket
                        has
                        a
                        price
                        in
                        the local fish market because now it has both value in use and value in
                        exchange.<br><br>
                        The trout in the fisherman’s basket has value in use when the fisherman chooses to
                        consume
                        it.
                        The
                        work
                        done
                        in such a closed producer-consumer loop has no value in exchange and thus no relative
                        valuation
                        is
                        required.<br><br>
                        The trout in the fisherman’s basket has both value in use and value in exchange when the
                        fisherman
                        decides
                        to bring it to the local fish market for others to consume it, a surplus good for sale,
                        a
                        commodity.<br><br>
                        I see, only surplus goods for sale must have a relative valuation in order to be
                        exchanged,
                        right?
                        Yes. Commodities are goods that are produced solely to be exchanged, and thus are
                        subject to
                        relative
                        valuation.
                        How will it work in real life?<br><br>
                        If the fisherman decides to exchange its surplus production for, let’s say, venison with
                        the
                        hunter,
                        then a
                        relative valuation is in order.<br><br>
                        How do the fisherman and the hunter agree on an exchange rate?<br><br>
                        They must consider the relative abundance of the natural resources to be exchanged and
                        the
                        relative
                        ability
                        of both fisherman and hunter to meet market demand.<br><br>
                        The fisherman and hunter are both producers and consumers of each other’s surplus goods
                        and
                        as
                        such
                        very
                        familiar with the local market economic markers to be considered in order to establish
                        the
                        relative
                        exchange
                        rate.<br><br>
                        How does concrete labor become abstract labor?<br><br>
                        Work that’s done in an open producer-consumer loop becomes abstract labor the moment the
                        market
                        bidding
                        process starts to establish an exchange rate between consumers and suppliers based on
                        value
                        equivalency;
                        the
                        equal exchange of applied labor. Value equivalency occurs at the market clearance
                        price.<br><br>
                        What is capital?<br><br>
                        Capital goods embody labor done in the past and saved for use in the future as a
                        labor-saving
                        tool.
                        Capital
                        goods when applied to the production process enhance the productivity of labor. Capital
                        goods
                        can be
                        bought
                        and sold as a commodity, a right, a stock, or even an option.<br><br>
                        How is value equivalency measured?<br><br>
                        Through the use of universal equivalents. Value was initially measured using known local
                        goods
                        as
                        universal
                        equivalents, e.g., cows, cocoa, shells, or others.<br><br>
                        These original equivalents tended to be cumbersome to divide and transport and soon were
                        replaced by
                        precious metals, such as gold and silver for their value density, divisibility and high
                        portability.<br><br>
                        All commodity-based universal value equivalents are concrete measures of value by their
                        very
                        nature,
                        including currency based on the gold standard. Paper money based on the gold standard is
                        just a
                        printed
                        paper representation of gold as the universal equivalent.<br><br>
                        Fiat money, currency detached from the gold standard, is an abstract representation of
                        value.
                        Fiat
                        money
                        displaced all commodity based universal equivalents as a best fit measure of economic
                        value
                        to
                        close
                        the
                        universal equivalent historical cycle.<br><br>
                        How did markets become global?<br><br>
                        The use of ever improving tools in the production process enhanced the productivity of
                        the
                        labor
                        employed,
                        thus creating sustainable recurring surpluses that over time became available to be
                        exchanged in
                        markets.<br><br>
                        Market places were initially very limited geographically and insignificant vis-a-vis the
                        bulk of
                        economic
                        activities for thousands of years. They grew in size and influence with the growth of
                        agriculture
                        and
                        commodity production until they displaced all pre-capitalist economic activities and
                        became
                        universal.
                        Labor
                        and capital are also freely exchanged in global markets as commodities.<br><br>
                        What does a concrete market price measure?<br><br>
                        The market clearance price is the concrete appearance of applied abstract labor at a
                        particular
                        time
                        and
                        place. Suppliers place market bids to fulfill an open demand and consumers purchase the
                        bids
                        they
                        consider
                        best fits.<br><br>
                        Consumers and producers settle on a price that covers a specific combination of applied
                        labor
                        (capital
                        and
                        labor power) and a profit rate.<br><br>
                        That is, a market price measures the monetary value of a best fit market bid at a
                        specific
                        time
                        and
                        place.<br><br>
                        Best fit bids will attain the highest profit rates available while less optimal bids
                        will
                        fetch
                        a
                        lower
                        or
                        even negative profit rates. Bids, when successful, add value to the original invested
                        inputs,
                        thus
                        enhancing
                        capital accumulation, which in turn further improves labor productivity, and so
                        on.<br><br>
                        The core dynamics of a market economy places applied labor efficiency on steroids
                        flooding
                        global
                        markets
                        with ever improved and less costly commodities.<br><br>
                        Why market bids?<br><br>
                        Market bids are the most efficient allocation of scarce resources when information is
                        not
                        fully
                        available to
                        plot a maximizing resource utilization curve of the means of production.
                        Property rights are the legal linchpin at the core of all market bids. The dynamics of
                        capital
                        lead
                        to
                        capital concentrating on fewer and fewer hands, increasing its supply; which, in turn,
                        puts
                        downward
                        pressure on the rate of return and exacerbates the intensity of the biddings.
                        In a world where information from all economic agents is readily available and
                        actionable,
                        market
                        bids
                        will
                        become inefficient and will wither away.<br><br>
                        What is a crisis of overproduction?<br><br>
                        The daily fight to overcome scarcity has defined our existence up to now, humanity has
                        toiled to
                        provide
                        for
                        its most fundamental needs with ever more powerful tools. Our productive capacity today
                        is
                        able
                        to
                        reach
                        the
                        abundance threshold and cover the total demand for an increasing number of
                        commodities.<br><br>
                        However, in a market economy overproduction occurs when suppliers overrun the effective
                        demand,
                        that
                        is,
                        the
                        demand of those consumers willing and able to pay the market price.<br><br>
                        When a market enters an overproduction crisis, producers are sent a strong signal to
                        drastically
                        reduce
                        output, even though whole populations remain unprovided.<br><br>
                        A sabotage of the abundance threshold?<br><br>
                        Yes, a market crisis of overproduction is a legal sabotage of society’s productive
                        capacity;
                        the
                        result
                        of
                        an economy based on profits.<br><br>
                        Now that our labor productivity is reaching the abundance threshold, that is, the
                        absence of
                        scarcity,
                        recurrent crisis of overproduction keeps us in the scarcity gravitational pull. This
                        fundamental
                        contradiction is the core conflict defining our epoch.<br><br>
                        Where is capitalism headed?<br><br>
                        The impact of robotics and artificial intelligence on the growth of applied labor
                        productivity
                        will
                        be a
                        qualitative change in the productive capacity of humanity. However, the massive
                        displacement
                        of
                        labor
                        will
                        have a restrictive effect on effective demand. In other words, the closer we get to the
                        threshold of
                        abundance, the more restrictive the effective demand will be, and therefore the greater
                        the
                        frequency of
                        crises of overproduction. <br><br>

                        The enormous inequality in the distribution of wealth is directly related to the
                        instability
                        of
                        financial
                        markets and social anxiety. Significant taxes on wealth will reduce their concentration
                        and
                        provide
                        revenue
                        to maximize investments in public goods, in the promotion of education, human welfare
                        and
                        development,
                        and
                        in environmental protection.<br><br>
                        Markets’ influence will diminish as scarcity is conquered for an ever-increasing number
                        of
                        commodities.<br><br>
                        We can foresee a future where the supplying of humanity’s needs becomes a resource
                        accounting
                        and
                        distribution algorithm on an artificial intelligence subroutine program.<br><br>
                        Free of want, humanity will walk a new historical path and, finally united, it will
                        raise
                        its
                        gaze
                        at
                        the
                        stars with renewed impetus.</p><br><br>

                    <h4>CONSCIOUSNESS AND EXISTENCE</h4>
                    <h5>Time and the Logic of Change</h5>
                    <blockquote>“Nature’s adaptive randomness is time consuming; human adaptive creativity is time
                        busting.”
                        -The teal lion</blockquote>
                    <p>In the beginning there was matter and antimatter, electrons and positrons. Millionths of a second
                        latter
                        quarks aggregated to create protons and neutrons, and within minutes they combined to usher on
                        nuclei.<br><br>
                        Einstein’s formula tells us that it takes a huge amount of energy to create a small amount of
                        matter,
                        thus the bang required to create the known universe must have been really big.<br><br>
                        Three hundred and eighty thousand years after its birth, the universe expanded and cooled enough
                        for
                        conditions to be ripe for the formation of stable atomic bonds to create the known universe more
                        than
                        fourteen billion years ago.<br><br>
                        Hydrogen, the first natural complex system was born. The hydrogen atom was ready to do what
                        natural
                        systems do, engage their environment.<br><br>
                        In the core of stars, hydrogen atoms fused at high temperatures and under massive pressures to
                        create
                        helium, a highly stable atom. These two elements make up 99.9 percent of the known matter in the
                        universe. System’s complexity increased as heavier elements were forged deep in the first stars
                        and
                        the
                        periodic table of the elements began to be filled. Organized matter became a reality.<br><br>
                        What are these complex systems?<br><br>
                        Complex systems are open, adaptive material entities that populate the universe. They are
                        everywhere,
                        from simple elements to molecules to galaxies, from physical systems to cultural ones, from
                        unicellular
                        animals to humans.<br><br>
                        Do they have a functional structure?<br><br>
                        Yes. Complex systems consist of inflow, stocks (main body), outflow and feedback loops.
                        What are their core functions?<br><br>
                        Connectivity and adaptability are the core functionalities of complex systems.<br><br>
                        How does it work?<br><br>
                        System’s stock, its main frame, process incoming flows, capture their energy, and out process
                        what
                        is
                        left as waste. They are also in charge of system stability by acting as shock absorbers when its
                        change
                        dynamics is detrimental to its survival.<br><br>
                        How does it know that?<br><br>
                        System’s feedback loops.<br><br>
                        These feedback loops relay final outcome information that enhances system’s response to the
                        local
                        environment in terms of connectivity and adaptive capabilities.<br><br>
                        How are adaptive capabilities developed?<br><br>
                        The interplay of forces at the margin drives connectivity and the availability of novel adaptive
                        solutions to evergreen challenges posed by the local environment.<br><br>
                        Complex systems’ diversity begets robustness by providing a higher number of most probable
                        solutions
                        to
                        nature’s riddles and societal needs.<br><br>
                        Can you provide an example of this interplay?<br><br>
                        Oxygen’s balancing energy loop on the lookout to fill the two empty spots available in its outer
                        electron orbit to attain valance neutrality, attracted and fused with two hydrogen atoms to
                        usher
                        into
                        existence the water molecule with its emergent wetness quality, a precursor of life.<br><br>
                        What are emergent qualities?<br><br>
                        Emergent qualities are the appearance of a new, qualitatively different reality. They are a
                        self-organized phenomenon of complex systems, such as wetness in water, the division of labor in
                        society, or consciousness in homo sapiens.<br><br>
                        How does a new reality show up?<br><br>
                        The dynamics of change moves from the accumulation of incremental changes to a new emergent
                        reality,
                        that is, from quantitative modifications to a qualitative transformation of the original system.
                        The
                        fusion of oxygen and hydrogen, two distinct elements, results in the appearance of the water
                        molecule, a
                        new reality.<br><br>
                        So, dialectics is the logic of evolution, the logic of change. Right?<br><br>
                        Yes. A seed is no longer a seed the moment the bud is born, so is the bud the moment the blossom
                        springs
                        into life, and the blossom itself is no longer the moment the fruit becomes a reality.<br><br>
                        In Hegelian terms, the bud negates the seed to assert itself, so does the blossom with the bud
                        and
                        the
                        fruit with the blossom.<br><br>
                        The cycle of life is fleeting, a continuous movement of being and becoming, a perennial
                        affirmation
                        and
                        negation of reality.<br><br>
                        It took billions of years for life to first appear on Earth as microbes some 3.7 billion years
                        ago.
                        Bacteria that used the Sun’s energy evolved 2.4 billion years ago; multicellular life some 800
                        million
                        years ago; plants 470 million years ago; and land animal at least 420 million years ago.<br><br>
                        Mammals evolved in the shadows of the dinosaurs 210 million years ago; primates first appeared
                        in
                        fossil
                        records some 55 million years ago; homo habilis evolved in Africa 2 million years ago, and
                        finally;
                        homo
                        sapiens did so 300 thousand years ago.<br><br>
                        A biological system’s dominant feedback loop determines its progression, that is, its birth,
                        growth,
                        maturity and final demise.<br><br>
                        Nature, by selecting the fittest, encourages biological changes that sustain adaptation to the
                        local
                        environment and the species’ survival.<br><br>
                        Is sexual reproduction a change agent?<br><br>
                        Yes. Sexual reproduction draws upon the genetic stock of a whole species to present novel
                        adaptive
                        alternatives at the margin. Survival rests on the species’ ability to connect and adapt promptly
                        to
                        its
                        local environment.<br><br>
                        Why does natural selection require such a long timeframe?<br><br>
                        When adaptive capabilities depend on ramdon variations and time is not an issue, the
                        possibilities
                        are
                        endless. Nature’s adaptive randomness is time consuming.<br><br>
                        How about cultural creative systems?<br><br>
                        Cultural systems, on the other hand, are driven by the creativity of our minds through
                        technological
                        innovations. Viable innovations are the product of humanity’s collective brain ability to
                        connect
                        and
                        adapt.<br><br>
                        Can you expand on the subject?<br><br>
                        Fire, its management and utilization, was the first innovation that changed the course of human
                        history
                        some 1.7 million years ago. Nevertheless, it took hundreds of thousands of years before the
                        introduction
                        of agriculture and animal husbandry impacted human society in a similar manner by providing the
                        material
                        conditions for the development of writing and the dawn of civilization.<br><br>
                        The printing press that made knowledge accessible on a mass scale for the first time came
                        thousands
                        of
                        years afterwards. The steam engine that propelled the industrial revolution needed only hundreds
                        of
                        years. And the telegraph that made communications on a global scale a reality took just decades,
                        as
                        did
                        electricity; an epoch defining innovation.<br><br>
                        How about the latest innovations?<br><br>
                        The scientific revolution and the economic utilization of modern applied science have
                        accelerated
                        the
                        pace of sophisticated emergent technologies. Massive public investments in basic science and
                        cutting-edge technology have provided the momentum required to successfully imbed in the global
                        economic
                        cycle such a transformative leap forward.<br><br>
                        Nuclear fission gave us nuclear power; the application of quantum mechanics gave us lasers,
                        electron
                        microscopes, magnetic resonance imaging devices and the components used in computer hardware.
                        Genetics’
                        advances have given us for the first time the ability to edit life’s operating manual.
                        Information
                        technologies provide us with ever faster processing speed and growing storage
                        capabilities.<br><br>
                        These recurrent quantitative changes have brought us today to a new quality; nuclear fusion,
                        genetic
                        editing, and artificial intelligence. These three transformative emergent innovations will alter
                        human
                        society in a profound way.<br><br>
                        Nuclear fusion and genetic editing are scientific breakthroughs in the physical and biological
                        sciences
                        respectively; artificial intelligence (AI) is an emergent quality of advances in information
                        technologies.<br><br>
                        What is natural intelligence?<br><br>
                        Natural intelligence is our virtual reality, our consciousness always interacting with the local
                        environment and the universe. Our brain has a limited storage and computing capacity prone to
                        information overloads that will diminish both our concentration and contemplation abilities, a
                        negative
                        drawback; thus, moving information storage and computing capacity to peripheral technologies is
                        of
                        the
                        essence.<br><br>
                        What is artificial intelligence?<br><br>
                        Artificial Intelligence uses language to codify and store huge quantities of historical
                        knowledge
                        that
                        it can then retrieve with ever faster processing speeds to respond to our virtual queries. AI is
                        an
                        extension of our brain, a highly sophisticated tool at our disposal.<br><br>
                        What is AI’s emergent quality?<br><br>
                        AI has the ability to quickly access vast amounts of historical knowledge, search for all
                        available
                        options, and provide best fit solutions to our queries; a valuable emergent technology.<br><br>
                        Can AI adapt to the universe as our brain does?<br><br>
                        No. AI’s adaptive capabilities are limited to its data base, its past. AI is blind to random
                        events
                        that
                        are not yet in its data base. AI does not have a sense of the other. A codified data base is
                        unable
                        “to
                        mirror” another.<br><br>
                        How about innovations in productive capacity?<br><br>
                        Exchange, the trade of goods between groups, draws upon the history of comparative advantages to
                        promote
                        the global division of labor. Robotics and artificial intelligence-controlled processes will
                        shoot
                        labor
                        productivity up to levels unheard of. Atomic fusion will make energy clean, plentiful, and
                        cheap.
                        Finally, gene-editing will enhance carbon-free food production, wipe out hunger, and eliminate
                        human
                        suffering as we know it, making life longer lasting and way more pleasurable.<br><br>
                        Are we at an inflection point?<br><br>
                        Yes. These feedback loops are at the core of humanity’s creative palette that sustains and
                        pushes
                        forward ever shrinking timeframes that are now churning emergent technological innovations at a
                        breakneck speed.<br><br>
                        Human adaptive creativity is time busting.<br><br>

                    </h5>
                    <blockquote>“Preserving life is the only condition that is inherent to humanity.”
                        -The teal lion</blockquote>
                    <p>The Sun is overrated. What is unique about the Sun is us; the fact that in its third orbiting
                        planet,
                        nature attained consciousness.<br><br>
                        It took some time to do so though…<br><br>
                        Yes, billions of years.<br><br>
                        We are newborns, aren’t we?<br><br>
                        Of course, and suckling mother nature for our survival.<br><br>
                        What are we before our birth?<br><br>
                        A genetic probability.<br><br>
                        Just that?<br><br>
                        Yes, and we will continue to be until our number is up and our existence is realized, which does
                        not
                        just depend on us as individuals. We are beholden to the survival of our species.<br><br>
                        What is the beyond before our birth like?<br><br>
                        Fair. We all have the same chance of becoming emperors or paupers, beautiful or ugly, geniuses
                        or
                        borderline; in short, the genetic roulette has no bias or limit in time or space, unless as a
                        species we
                        cross into extinction.<br><br>
                        And after our death?<br><br>
                        A genetic probability. We are the concrete appearance of an abstract probability.<br><br>
                        Why don’t we care about the beyond before our birth?<br><br>
                        Because we are as yet not aware of our existence. God feeds on our existential
                        insecurities.<br><br>
                        What is life?<br><br>
                        We can say that life is the opposite of the inert, an additional degree of complexity of nature,
                        the
                        basic formula of which is the periodic table of the elements.<br><br>
                        Life has its own operating manual. Living entities compute the inherited codified genetic
                        information
                        during their life cycle and pass it on to the next generation.<br><br>
                        And conscious life?<br><br>
                        Conscious life is a qualitative change of nature. It is the moment in which matter became aware
                        of
                        itself.<br><br>
                        Are we special?<br><br>
                        Yes and no. Yes, because in our brain, matter negated itself, and became conscious. No, because
                        said
                        qualitative transformation was and is a natural process on our planet, as it can be in
                        others.<br><br>
                        What if we’re alone?<br><br>
                        In the scale of billions, the improbable becomes certain; it took more than 14 billion years in
                        our
                        case, half the lifespan of our universe. We don’t know how that compares to the average. As far
                        as
                        we
                        know, we may be the most precocious.<br><br>
                        Is there life after death?<br><br>
                        Yes, through the expansion of our genetic pool. The species is what matters not the
                        individual.<br><br>
                        Eve, the first human Mom was an African woman. She claimed an erotic life independent of her
                        ovulation
                        cycle; her sexual fantasies broke the reproductive determinism of the animal kingdom and defined
                        the
                        beginning of our species.<br><br>
                        Were we close to extinction then?<br><br>
                        Yes. Our species originated in the south of Africa with a very limited genetic pool,
                        nevertheless,
                        thanks to sexual reproduction and mobility, it needed only a few million years to acquire the
                        enormous
                        genetic diversity it has today. Our ancestors attained escape velocity and were able to leave
                        their
                        birth continent to conquer and populate the planet, a feat of survival.<br><br>
                        Is life just a recurrent cycle?<br><br>
                        Yes and no. The cycle of birth, growth, reproduction, and death is recurrent but not always the
                        same
                        given that the genetic clay can mutate and give rise to quantitative changes that can spawn a
                        new
                        reality.<br><br>
                        How do we get to know the universe?<br><br>
                        The physical world is independent of our consciousness. Our virtual reality is built by praxis,
                        a
                        process of evergreen approximations.<br><br>
                        A virtual reality of our own, right?<br><br>
                        Yes. Abstract reality once captured can be manipulated at will.<br><br>
                        How do we know how close we are to reality?<br><br>
                        Praxis corroborates the predictive power of our virtual reality on future events.<br><br>
                        Is our virtual reality temporary?<br><br>
                        Yes. The paradigm with the higher predictive power is always chosen.<br><br>
                        Is our virtual reality opposed to nature?<br><br>
                        Yes. It has a life of its own, it’s handy and personal. Nature is the opposite, rigid and
                        timeless;
                        the
                        universe is stubborn. In the romance languages the moon is a lady to whom poets dedicate
                        romantic
                        overtures, and at the same time, it is an arid, crater-filled satellite.<br><br>
                        Are we aware of others like us?<br><br>
                        Yes, our brain’s executive function is able to identify a mind out there. Concepts of beauty,
                        imitation,
                        language, and a moral compass are hardwired in our brain structure. The concept of the blank
                        sheet
                        is a
                        myth.<br><br>
                        How so?<br><br>
                        Our brain is both rational and empathic; personal and communal; opposed to but also an integral
                        part
                        of
                        nature, a truly dialectical entity. Language is innate to the human brain in the same way that
                        web
                        building is innate to a spider brain. It’s architecture and oral expression are
                        universal.<br><br>
                        Our brain is born still immature for natural reasons; its development will require more than a
                        million
                        new connections per second during the first five years of life. Furthermore, it will also need a
                        few
                        more years of maturity to discern and judge. Finally, it will take 25 years to reach full
                        maturity.<br><br>
                        Are we born free?<br><br>
                        Freedom is relative. We don’t choose our parents when we’re born, nor do we choose our family,
                        our
                        nationality, our culture, or our language. We are born into it.<br><br>
                        From the very beginning of our life, the process of indoctrination to which we are subjected is
                        brutal
                        and is meant to give us an identity that binds us to the tribe.<br><br>
                        How strong are these bindings?<br><br>
                        Cultural ties are so strong that they fill large portions of our ego and make up the totality of
                        our
                        super-ego.<br><br>
                        Are we manipulated by the tribe from the start?<br><br>
                        Yes. Our virtual reality, by its very nature, can be influenced and manipulated. Cultural
                        indoctrination
                        is a claim that our group has special qualities, usually superior, vis-à-vis other
                        groups.<br><br>
                        Is group cohesiveness natural?<br><br>
                        Yes. It was essential for the survival of our species.<br><br>
                        What specifically?<br><br>
                        It provides us a group identity and a sense of belonging.<br><br>
                        Do we have free will?<br><br>
                        Yes, within our cultural indoctrination. We are ever constrained by the impositions of that
                        straitjacket.<br><br>
                        And an ingrained fear of the other?<br><br>
                        Yes. Tribal indoctrination instills fear of the other as a defensive mechanism of the tribe
                        survival
                        that has made us prone to recurrent orgies of brutality, and destruction.<br><br>
                        Does the universe have a purpose?<br><br>
                        No, the universe does not have a purpose. The universe just is.<br><br>
                        And living beings?<br><br>
                        Yes, to propagate the species. Preserving life is the only condition that is inherent to
                        humanity.<br><br>
                        And us as individuals?<br><br>
                        Yes. Only as individuals we do have goals in life beyond our own survival and therefore free
                        will in
                        their pursuit.<br><br>
                        Does living with others limit our free will?<br><br>
                        Yes. Social harmony is predicated upon the principle of respect to the right of others.<br><br>
                        That is, turning the other cheek?<br><br>
                        No. That is avoiding the slap altogether. Our freedom stops at the border of the other’s
                        personal
                        private integrity.<br><br>
                        A freedom of the commons?<br><br>
                        Yes, a regulated freedom of the commons for all its citizens that affirms life, liberty and the
                        pursue
                        of happiness to all.<br><br>
                        And a right to privacy?<br><br>
                        Yes. An unregulated personal private space where our individuality and personal integrity are
                        off
                        limits
                        of the commons.<br><br>
                        It looks like two opposite moral compasses?<br><br>
                        No. The relationship between a regulated commons where our freedoms are limited in order to live
                        in
                        communitarian harmony and a personal private free space where the commons is off limits and we
                        can
                        fully
                        be ourselves is dialectical in nature.<br><br>
                        A permanent tension between the commons and the individual?<br><br>
                        Yes. The autonomy of both the public and of the private sphere are fundamental social opposites
                        of
                        life
                        in a free society.<br><br>
                        We face the universe and our own virtual reality alone and vulnerable. We begin communicating
                        and
                        developing language abilities, imitating and learning established codes of conduct necessary to
                        protect
                        the integrity of life itself. We stand as equals when interacting with our peers as
                        free-standing
                        individual’s worth at being considered in their own right. However, we become part of the tribe
                        when
                        we
                        are faced with the requirements of everyday life, a heavy but unavoidable burden. Ethical
                        principles
                        are
                        intended to protect the integrity of the public sphere.<br><br>
                        What is the relationship between politics and the commons?<br><br>
                        Politics is the exercise of power within the defined boundaries of the public sphere. Political
                        majorities must not only respect the established boundaries of the commons but must also rule
                        providing
                        avenues for effective dissent, that is, those in power have the ethical imperative to ascertain
                        that
                        power can be legally contested.<br><br>
                        I see, any monopoly of power is by definition unethical, right?<br><br>
                        Yes. No faction should be trusted with unchecked authority. The legitimate exercise of power
                        must
                        protect human dignity, individual privacy, and the fundamental rights of those temporarily out
                        of
                        power.<br><br>
                        Why have we become alienated from society?<br><br>
                        Powerlessness. Our ever-growing inability to control the economic and social forces that impact
                        our
                        survival.<br><br>
                        The profit motive overrules for the vast majority the predictability of survival. Furthermore,
                        capital
                        systemic, unsustainable growth dynamics stretches to the breaking point the ecological limits of
                        the
                        planet.<br><br>
                        Has this alienation become existential?<br><br>
                        Yes. We feel vulnerable when we have no control of our environment and frantically search for an
                        alter-ego that would offer protection, something like an almighty placebo.<br><br>
                        Paradise?<br><br>
                        Yes, the conceptual underpinning of paradise is the virtual reality of a conflict free, forever
                        harmonious, worry-free abstraction.<br><br>
                        And in the real world?<br><br>
                        Our social reality is bogged down in fundamental contradictions that keep us on the verge of
                        existential
                        collapse. At a time of exponential creative boom that brings us closer to the threshold of
                        abundance,
                        our economic rules of the game tie us to the ghost of scarcity. Furthermore, in the middle of an
                        ecological crisis that points to the heart of our survival as a species, our rules of the
                        political
                        game
                        tie us to the ghost of hatred. In a moment of existential crisis, we take refuge in the tribe
                        and in
                        the
                        darkest part of our consciousness, a contradiction that bring us to the limits of
                        consciousness.<br><br>
                        Rudderless, humanity is navigating powerful forces without a plan nor destination, and we as
                        individuals
                        have been forced back to survival mode. No one is coming to our rescue, we are on our own. The
                        universe
                        is blind to us.<br><br>

                    <h4>EPILOGUE</h4>
                    <h5>An existential crossroad</h5>
                    <blockquote>“We are everything the universe is not, aware; the universe is everything we are not,
                        timeless.”
                        -The teal lion</blockquote>
                    <p>Are we at an existential crossroad?<br><br>
                        Yes. Our species will perish if we commit ecological suicide either by action or by omission.
                        There
                        is
                        not planet B.<br><br>
                        Can you elaborate?<br><br>
                        Yes. We might perish in a nuclear Armageddon. We are still not out of the woods; the
                        probabilities
                        of a
                        self-inflicted apocalypse are still high.<br><br>
                        In addition, we remain oblivious to the fact that the current trajectory of global warming
                        points to
                        a
                        catastrophic denouement; a Venus-type runaway greenhouse effect maelstrom.<br><br>
                        What are we to do?<br><br>
                        Right now, we must push hard to develop technological options to quickly reduce the current
                        level of
                        carbon in the atmosphere and that of future carbon emissions produced as a result of human
                        activities.
                        Achieving a stable atmospheric equilibrium will require a steady flow of public funding over the
                        coming
                        years in order to provide the space necessary to achieve interplanetary mobility.<br><br>
                        How do we attain escape velocity?<br><br>
                        We must shatter our existential insecurities and wean ourselves of our solar dependency.<br><br>
                        Wean ourself of our solar dependency, how?<br><br>
                        Exercising control of nuclear fusion will give us an avenue to exit our solar dependent
                        cocoon.<br><br>
                        Really?<br><br>
                        Yes. Remember how cowed humanity was before gaining control of fire? Well, that’s how we are
                        now,
                        afraid
                        to challenge the cosmos.<br><br>
                        Our solar cocoon was a vital one but one we have outlived. Control of nuclear fusion will end
                        our
                        solar
                        dependency, a new reality.<br><br>
                        A transformative technological leap that will provide us a real chance of escaping our birth
                        planet
                        and
                        attain interplanetary, and with time, interstellar mobility. A survival feat beyond the
                        divine.<br><br>
                        Is the universe timeless?<br><br>
                        We are everything the universe is not, aware. The universe is everything we are not, timeless.
                        Timelessness is relative. For a female Mayfly whose lifespan is five minutes, ours is timeless,
                        thus
                        for
                        us so is the universe. Our universe is young, teeming with energy and full of vitality,
                        nevertheless,
                        everything that has a beginning must have an end.<br><br>
                        Order requires energy; thus, as long as the universe is expanding orderly complex systems will
                        populate
                        it. Once the energy of the big bang is spent, entropy, the natural tendency to greater disorder
                        will
                        prevail and the universe, as we know it, will cease to exist. At the very end, it will be full
                        of
                        motionless elementary particles, pitch black, soundless, and cold, just like a colossal
                        sarcophagus.<br><br>
                        So, that’s it?<br><br>
                        Well, it depends…<br><br>
                        It depends on what?<br><br>
                        On the total amount of matter. Repulsion forces produced the big bang and the current expansion
                        we
                        are
                        in, attraction (gravitational) forces will do the opposite if enough matter is present in the
                        end to
                        reach a tipping point and initiate a universal contraction, a big crunch.<br><br>
                        I see. Never a dull moment.<br><br>

                    <h5>Dialectics of Nature</h5>
                    <blockquote>“Life is the drive to persist, to oppose the general entropy of the universe.” -The teal
                        lion
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>The physical world is impermanent and, at the margins, uncertain.<br><br>

                        At the very beginning, the Singularity was no longer. It negated itself the moment the microwave
                        background radiation signaled the unfolding of space-time.<br><br>

                        Our universe is a process-centered reality with a past, a present, and a future at any given
                        moment.
                        The
                        past is accounting, the present is certain, and the future is probable, from almost certain to
                        randomness. Change is the dynamics interplay of opposite probabilities defining a given
                        reality.<br><br>

                        Reality has agency on the present where competing probable outcomes framed by their physical or
                        biological constrains can either remain the same, change quantitatively, or evolve a new
                        reality, a
                        change in quality.<br><br>

                        Organized matter became a reality when the strong nuclear force glued together positrons,
                        quarks,
                        and
                        neutrons to usher in atomic nuclei as the universe cool a bit after its formation. Once positive
                        charged
                        nuclei were present, electromagnetic forces pulled negative charged electrons to their orbits to
                        attain
                        electromagnetic equilibrium, that is, charge neutrality. Hydrogen, the first atomic element, was
                        born.<br><br>

                        Clauds of hydrogen atoms quickly formed and filled the primal world. These massive formations
                        grew
                        ever
                        larger, reaching a tipping point and collapsing under their own gravitational pull to give rise
                        to
                        the
                        first generation of stars.<br><br>

                        The newly formed stars began their celestial life cycle by turning on their nuclear fusion
                        engines.
                        Hydrogen atoms, their atomic fuel, were smashed into Helium, emitting as a byproduct energy in
                        the
                        form
                        of photons. Millions of suns sprang up. The universe’s lights were now on.<br><br>

                        The first generation of stars matured and burned their hydrogen fuel until it was exhausted. In
                        the
                        throes of death, they created in a flurry and dispersed onto the universe, sometimes violently,
                        the
                        remaining natural elements of the periodic table.<br><br>

                        Star dust negated itself an became organized matter, an emergent physical reality.<br><br>

                        In the stellar cauldron, the strong nuclear force controls all nuclear fusion processes and its
                        corresponding energy emissions; on the other hand, the weak nuclear force uses radioactive
                        nuclear
                        decay
                        to bring into natural equilibrium unusually unstable heavy nuclei.<br><br>

                        Furthermore, the electromagnetic force keeps elements on a charge neutral steady state; and its
                        valence
                        algorithm control the combining power of all elements through chemical bond formation. Lastly,
                        the
                        gravitational force tells matter how to move once matter has curved space-time.<br><br>

                        These four natural forces, once established, are the grids that support the movement of matter
                        and
                        energy in the universe, its laws of motion.<br><br>

                        Physics set; the universe transitioned to chemistry.<br><br>

                        Elements combined through chemical bonding in order to attain valence neutrality giving birth to
                        chemical compounds, an emergent new reality. Thus, oxygen and hydrogen, when bonded, ushered in
                        the
                        water molecule (H2O) with its emergent wetness quality, a precursor of life. Similarly, carbon
                        when
                        bonded with hydrogen ushered in the methane molecule (CH4), and when bonded with oxygen the
                        carbon
                        dioxide one (CO2).<br><br>

                        Carbon abundance and bonding capabilities made it a precursor of life on Earth. A high valence
                        chemical
                        element, carbon had the ability to make single, double, and triple bonds. Furthermore, carbon
                        could
                        string together long, complex, highly stable compounds able to store and process information.
                        Bonding
                        complexity is path determined (bonding choices) and cumulative in time. Bonding complexity has
                        grown
                        from a handful of pairings, as is the case of the water molecule, to sixty bonding pairings and
                        up,
                        as
                        is the case of highly complex proteins.<br><br>

                        Uranium was also an abundant element during the formation of our planet. These heavy elements
                        are
                        prone
                        to radioactive nuclear decay (nuclear fission), a source of highly concentrated energy. This
                        energy,
                        when combined with water, ushered in primeval geysers. The energy output of such radioactive
                        geysers
                        propelled the chemistry of life into existence.<br><br>

                        Chemistry transition to biology.<br><br>

                        Life is the drive to persist, to oppose the general entropy of the universe.<br><br>

                        Cells are the foundation of all living organisms. They are made up of long, complex information
                        driven
                        organic compounds organized inside a tangible material boundary that keeps out the external
                        world.
                        Cells
                        regularly update an evergreen model of the local environment through feedback channels.<br><br>

                        Cells as living organism have agency; they are autonomous complex systems organized to process
                        energy
                        efficiently in order to sustain themselves.<br><br>

                        Adaptation is pathway determined; it entails choosing successful changes. The natural art of
                        choosing
                        has three components: pattern recognition, judgements, and decision making. This natural process
                        is
                        embedded in all living organisms as an innate quality of its agency, that is, of its biological
                        intelligence.<br><br>

                        Movement is a goal oriented spatial displacement designed to reposition the living entity onto a
                        more
                        advantageous setting. Behavior is a pattern of movements executed as an innate response to
                        recurrent
                        local environmental conditions.<br><br>

                        Evolution packs causal potential into life. The cycle of life is fleeting, a continuous movement
                        of
                        being and becoming, a perennial affirmation, and negation of reality.<br><br>

                        Single cells with no internal specialization (prokaryotic) provided the original cellular
                        blueprint.
                        Prokaryotic bacteria pioneered both the use of enzymes (proteins that speed up chemical
                        reactions)
                        and
                        that of sunlight (photosynthesis) in order to feed itself. These primal cells evolved
                        mitochondria
                        and
                        latter on semi-specialized organelles to enhance energy throughput processing
                        (eukaryotic).<br><br>

                        Mitochondria is a bacteria induced adaptation, a symbiotic partnership (horizontal gene
                        transfer)
                        deployed to enhance an eukaryotic cell’s ability to tackle an ecological niche. Chloroplast, the
                        organelle that contains the photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll in plants cells, is also a
                        bacteria
                        induced genetic entanglement. Eukaryotic cells evolved into multicellular organisms with the
                        same
                        genome
                        (fungi, algae).<br><br>

                        Plants use chlorophyll and sunlight to photosynthesize glucose and oxygen out of water and
                        carbon
                        dioxide. A symbiotic relationship between fungi and seaweed (algae) made possible the
                        proliferation
                        of
                        plant species on land, a precursor of animal life on the Earth surface.<br><br>

                        Fungi release enzymes to break down and absorb soil minerals such as phosphorus that it can
                        exchange
                        for
                        host plants’ organic carbon compounds. Fungi have developed vast roots entanglements (wood wide
                        network)
                        able to transport carbon, minerals and water from areas of abundance to those of scarcity. Fungi
                        have
                        also synthesized powerful mind-altering biochemical substances to gain control of host insects.
                        Fungi
                        can feed, kill, or hallucinate us.

                        Multicellular organism with the same genome further promoted the division of labor and evolved
                        highly
                        specialized functions (tissues, neurons, organs). Life scaled up its structure giving rise to
                        more
                        complex organism that required ever greater efficiency, organization, and control (sexual
                        reproduction,
                        senses, neurons, backbone, brain). These quantitative transformations led to a new quality;
                        sentient
                        life.<br><br>

                        The cataclysmic disappearance of the big reptilians, a random event, opened the evolutionary
                        door to
                        the
                        warm-blooded mammalians. An explosion of new life replenished the planet’s former animal
                        exuberance.
                        Climatic changes caused the African jungle to recede and the savanna to expand, enticing an
                        evolutionary
                        line of the big apes to descend from the trees, walk upright, and free their hands. The journey
                        of
                        the
                        free hand to do ever more sophisticated work was the evolutionary roadmap followed by the
                        developing
                        human brain.<br><br>

                        Caloric budgeting (calories in/out balance sheet) and body homeostasis regulation take a big
                        chunk
                        of
                        our brain’s capacity just to keep us alive and functioning.<br><br>

                        A genetic mutation 10 million years ago gave us the ability to digest certain alcohols. This
                        mutation
                        opened up a whole new caloric reservoir since now we were able to eat the fermented fruit fallen
                        from
                        the trees and scattered on the African savanna, thus enhancing our survival prospects.<br><br>

                        In the meantime, female ovulation cycles became fully detached from the mammalians’ sexual heat
                        drive,
                        giving human sexuality agency. Eve’s erotic fantasies gave her both sexual autonomy and a
                        virtual,
                        abstract reality. She was now self-aware.<br><br>

                        The universe is dull and silent, colored a cosmic latte. Sounds and colors are a construe of our
                        senses
                        and of our brain on the basis of differences in air pressure or sunlight wave frequency,
                        respectively.
                        They exist as such only in our virtual reality. The universe’s beauty is our
                        abstraction.<br><br>

                        Chemical bonds have a symbiotic relationship with the brain through the senses of smell and
                        taste.
                        Sensory cells located in the nose are able to identify chemical bonds and transmit that
                        information
                        to
                        the olfactory centers of the brain where they are classified as odors.<br><br>

                        Our sense of taste was always biased in favor of those local flavors that packed the most
                        calories,
                        such
                        as glucose and fats. Tasting is to food what music is to sound, and writing is to language, a
                        learned
                        skill.<br><br>

                        Emotions, on the other hand, are culture specific conceptual mappings of defined behaviors; a
                        learned
                        construe use as a short hand for human mood communication.<br><br>

                        Beauty is meant to be consumed and appreciated vicariously, that is, in the mind that
                        contemplates
                        it.
                        This dependence on the other’s conceptual reality in opposition to our own makes abstract beauty
                        a
                        critical marker in the transformation of homo to sapiens and the dawn of culture.<br><br>

                        Acknowledging the other’s existential reality opened the doors to our group consciousness and to
                        our
                        humanity, thus changing the trajectory of our species’ evolution from genetics to
                        culture.<br><br>

                        This qualitative change in our evolutionary timescale set us in a path of ever more control of
                        nature.
                        Tool’s development requires purpose, purpose requires anticipating a future use, and a future
                        tense
                        requires abstract reasoning.<br><br>

                        As free agents, humans are able to modify nature’s own constrains through the application of
                        technological tools, enhancing the degrees of freedom available to them at any given
                        time.<br><br>

                        Biology transitioned to culture.
